# Prompting Guide - Comprehensive LLM Instructions

## Overview

The Doc Digester uses **comprehensive, pedagogically-informed prompts** to guide GPT-4o through each phase of chapter analysis. Each prompt includes:

1. **System Prompt** - Defines the LLM's role and quality standards
2. **Reading Strategy** - Explicit instructions on HOW to read the text
3. **Schema Guide** - Field-by-field explanations of what to extract
4. **Concrete Example** - Full example showing expected output quality

## Design Principles

### ✅ Longer Prompts = Better Quality
- We prioritize **comprehensive guidance** over token efficiency
- Each phase prompt is 500-1500 tokens
- Includes detailed instructions, examples, and field descriptions
- Result: More accurate, thorough, pedagogically-sound analysis

### ✅ Extract ALL Concepts
- No artificial limits (e.g., "extract 5-10 concepts")
- Instructions emphasize "EVERY", "ALL", "comprehensive"
- Better to over-extract than miss important content
- Users can filter results post-processing if needed

### ✅ Very Specific Evidence Pointers
- Format: "Section 1.2, paragraph 3, lines 1-3"
- Not: "early in the chapter" or "middle section"
- Enables verification and citation
- Helps teachers locate source material

### ✅ Use null Only When Truly Nothing Exists
- Default: Extract and note uncertainty
- Example: "Uncertain if this entity is central, but mentioned in Section 2.1"
- Only use null for truly inapplicable fields
- Encourages thoroughness

### ✅ Iterative Prompt Improvement
- If LLM misuses a field → improve the prompt first
- Add clarifying examples
- Rephrase instructions
- Schema changes are last resort

## Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

### 1. **Role-Playing**
Each phase assigns the LLM a specific expert role:
- Phase 1: Teacher doing first read
- Phase 2: Curriculum designer creating lesson plan
- Phase 3: Critical scholar analyzing claims
- Phase 4: Curriculum architect synthesizing

### 2. **Explicit Reading Strategies**
Tell the LLM HOW to read, not just WHAT to extract:
- "Read as if you're preparing to teach"
- "Read for architecture, not just content"
- "Read as a fact-checker"
- "Synthesize from previous phases"

### 3. **Quality Standards**
Every phase includes success criteria:
- Completeness
- Accuracy
- Evidence-based
- Pedagogically sound

### 4. **Critical Rules**
Explicit do/don't statements:
- "Extract ALL significant X, not just major ones"
- "Use null ONLY when truly not applicable"
- "Provide VERY SPECIFIC evidence pointers"
- "Better to have too many than miss important ones"

### 5. **Few-Shot Learning**
Concrete examples show:
- Expected quality level
- Field usage patterns
- Evidence pointer format
- Appropriate level of detail

### 6. **Field-Level Guidance**
Schema guide explains each field:
- What it means
- What to include
- Format/examples
- When to use null

### 7. **JSON Structure Scaffolding**
User prompts include JSON structure outline to ensure correct format

### 8. **Context Passing**
Later phases receive earlier phase results:
- Phase 2: Gets Phase 1 for context
- Phase 3: Gets Phases 1+2
- Phase 4: Synthesizes Phases 1+2+3 (no original text)

## Token Economics

### Per-Request Token Usage

**Phase 1:**
- System prompt: ~400 tokens
- User prompt (with example): ~800 tokens
- Chapter text: varies (500-5000 tokens)
- **Total input**: ~1700-6200 tokens
- **Output**: ~500-2000 tokens

**Phase 2:**
- System prompt: ~450 tokens
- User prompt (with example + Phase 1): ~900 tokens
- Chapter text: varies (500-5000 tokens)
- **Total input**: ~1850-6350 tokens
- **Output**: ~800-3000 tokens

**Phase 3:**
- System prompt: ~500 tokens
- User prompt (with example + Phases 1+2): ~1000 tokens
- Chapter text: varies (500-5000 tokens)
- **Total input**: ~2000-6500 tokens
- **Output**: ~1000-4000 tokens

**Phase 4:**
- System prompt: ~400 tokens
- User prompt (with example + Phases 1+2+3): ~900 tokens
- NO chapter text (synthesis only)
- **Total input**: ~1300 tokens (+ previous phases data)
- **Output**: ~200-600 tokens

### Total Chapter Analysis

For a **10-page chapter** (~3000 tokens):
- **Input tokens**: ~20,000 tokens
- **Output tokens**: ~8,000 tokens
- **Total**: ~28,000 tokens
- **Cost (gpt-4o)**: ~$0.15-0.20

### Trade-off Analysis

**Benefits of Longer Prompts:**
- ✅ More accurate extractions (fewer retries needed)
- ✅ Better pedagogical quality
- ✅ More comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Reduced need for post-processing
- ✅ Consistent output quality

**Costs:**
- ❌ Higher token usage per request
- ❌ Slower generation (more tokens to process)

**Verdict:** The quality gains justify the token cost for educational content analysis where accuracy and completeness are critical.

## Improving Prompts

### If Field is Consistently Misused:

**Step 1: Analyze the Error**
- What is the LLM doing wrong?
- Is it misunderstanding the field purpose?
- Is it using the wrong format?
- Is it over/under-extracting?

**Step 2: Improve the Prompt**

Add to Schema Guide:
```python
**"problematic_field"**:
  • Common mistake: [describe what LLM does wrong]
  • Correct approach: [describe what it should do]
  • Example of WRONG: [show bad example]
  • Example of RIGHT: [show good example]
```

Add to Critical Rules:
```python
CRITICAL: Do NOT [describe wrong behavior].
Instead, [describe correct behavior].
```

Add to Example:
- Show the field used correctly
- Annotate with comments if needed

**Step 3: Test and Iterate**
- Run on sample chapters
- Check if improvement worked
- Refine further if needed

### Example: Fixing "Evidence Pointer" Format

**Original:** LLM returns "middle of chapter"

**Improved Prompt Addition:**
```python
**"evidence_pointer"**:
  • WRONG: "middle of chapter", "early in text", "near the end"
  • RIGHT: "Section 1.2, paragraph 3, lines 1-3"
  • RIGHT: "Introduction, paragraph 2, sentence 1"
  • RIGHT: "Page 42, sidebar on types"
  • Be VERY SPECIFIC: Section/paragraph/line or page/location
```

## Maintenance

### When to Update Prompts:

1. **New field added to schema** → Add to Schema Guide with examples
2. **Field consistently misused** → Improve guidance for that field
3. **Output quality degrades** → Review and strengthen quality standards
4. **New pedagogical framework** → Update Reading Strategy
5. **User feedback** → Incorporate clarifications

### Version Control:

Prompts are in `src/services/prompts.py`:
- Easy to track changes with git
- Can A/B test different prompts
- Can rollback if changes degrade quality

### Testing New Prompts:

```python
# Test with sample chapters
from src.services.llm_client import extract_comprehension_pass

test_chapter = "..."
result = extract_comprehension_pass(test_chapter)

# Check:
# - Are all fields populated appropriately?
# - Is evidence specific enough?
# - Is the quality high?
```
