Chapter 1: Introduction to Variables in Python

What is a Variable?

A variable in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in computer memory. Think of a variable as a labeled box that holds information. You can put data into the box (assignment), look at what's in the box (retrieval), or replace the contents with something new (reassignment).

Creating Variables

In Python, you create a variable by choosing a name and assigning it a value using the equals sign (=). For example:

    age = 25
    name = "Alice"
    temperature = 98.6

Python automatically determines the type of data based on the value you assign. The variable 'age' holds an integer, 'name' holds a string, and 'temperature' holds a floating-point number.

Variable Naming Rules

Python has specific rules for naming variables:
1. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore
2. The rest of the name can contain letters, numbers, or underscores
3. Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different)
4. You cannot use Python keywords as variable names

Good variable names are descriptive and help make your code readable. Use 'student_count' rather than 'sc' or 'x'.

Why Variables Matter

Variables are fundamental to all programming. They allow programs to store information, perform calculations, and remember results. Without variables, programs would be unable to process data or respond to user input.

In the next chapter, we will explore how to perform operations with variables and combine them in expressions.
